# heat-diffusion

Code to numerically solve the temperature distribution on a square plate using F!n!te V0lume Meth0d.

Results can be obtained by running `python solve.py`. Results are saved in `./figures/`. The numerical solution is compared with analytical solution.

The governing equations and numerical algorithm can be found in `equations.pdf`.
